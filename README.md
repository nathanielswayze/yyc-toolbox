## Installation

Download the DLL from Releases and inject it using your injector of choice.

## FAQ

### How does YYC Toolbox work?

YYC Toolbox works by injecting itself into the game and accessing the internal Runner structure via signature scanning. It's very much similar to a game cheat, and that's by design. It makes it easier to use (you see your changes at runtime) and it's easier for me to access the game's code.

### Do you have a Lua API?

A half-baked Lua API with a documentation we barely update? [Coming right up!](https://docs.x64dbg.ru/home)

### When do you plan on finishing YYC Toolbox?

Deadline's Q4 2025. May be pushed back to Q1 2026. Tough to say for sure.

### Can I use x from YYC Toolbox?

You may use any of the code from YYC Toolbox as long as you credit this repository in some-way (I.E. link in README or a fork). This project is licensed under the terms of the [GNU GPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license.

### How do I know when x happens?

Discord server. Link can be found at the beginning of this README.
